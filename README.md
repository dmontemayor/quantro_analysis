## Quantro Analysis

An analysis in R using the `quantro` package was conducted to quantify
global difference in the distribution of data. This analysis confirms the
existance of important global features that could be washed out if quantile
normalization would be performed. This analysis advises against quantile
normalization.

The analysis can be found as the R markdown file (quantro_analysis.Rmd)[quantro_analysis.Rmd].
