## Quantro Analysis

An analysis in R using the `quantro` package was conducted to quantify
global difference in the distribution of data. ~~This analysis confirms the
existence of important global features that could be washed out if quantile
normalization would be performed. This analysis advises against quantile
normalization.~~

The analysis can be reproduced with the R markdown file [quantro_analysis.Rmd](quantro_analysis.Rmd).

A [Report in Word format](NASA_quantro_analysis.docx) is provided.
