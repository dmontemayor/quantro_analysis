## Quantro Analysis

An analysis in R using the `quantro` package was conducted to quantify
global difference in the distribution of data. This analysis confirms the
existence of important global features that could be washed out if quantile
normalization would be performed. This analysis advises against quantile
normalization.

The reproducible analysis can be found as the R markdown file [quantro_analysis.Rmd](quantro_analysis.Rmd).

Reports in [Word](quantro_analysis.docx) and [HTML](quantro_analysis.html) formats are provided.
